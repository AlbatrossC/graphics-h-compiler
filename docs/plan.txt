1st step) Adjust LIB and Include path as per shown in Turbo.exe UI. 
            which is C:\TURBOC3\LIB
                     C:\TURBOC3\INCLUDE 
        and create a empty SOURCE folder in C:\TURBOC3 so final path is C:\TURBOC3\SOURCE  and in the SOURCE folder will be a sample test.cpp

2nd Step) Include other files like BGI and BIN aswell
3rd step) ZIP the TURBOC3 folder and name it tc.zip 

in index.html
1st) Extract tc.zip file
2nd) run commands in shell i.e 
        cd TURBOC3\\BIN

        // Ensure graphics driver is in working directory
        COPY ..\\BGI\\EGAVGA.BGI . 

        // Compile test.cpp (explicit include + lib + graphics.lib)
         "-c", "TCC.EXE -I..\\INCLUDE -L..\\LIB ..\\SOURCE\\TEST.CPP ..\\LIB\\GRAPHICS.LIB"

        // Clear screen and run
        "-c", "CLS",
        "-c", "TEST.EXE"
